# Privacy Policy for Read Later App

**Last Updated:** December 7, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how sak96 (referred to as "we," "us," "our," or "Company") handles information when you use our read-later service Android application (the "App").

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you understand our privacy practices. This policy applies to our App and does not apply to external websites that may be accessed through the App.

## 2. Data Collection by the App

### 2.1 What We Do NOT Collect

**We do not collect, store, or process any personal data about you directly.** Specifically:

- We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or other identifying information
- We do not collect location data
- We do not collect device identifiers or advertising IDs
- We do not use analytics services that track your behavior within the App
- We do not store your reading history, preferences, or saved articles on our servers
- We do not collect device information, operating system details, or hardware specifications
- We do not create user accounts or profiles

### 2.2 Local Storage Only

All data related to your use of the App (such as articles you save, reading lists, or preferences) is stored **locally on your device only**. We do not access, transmit, or store this data on our servers. You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time by clearing the App's data or uninstalling the App.

## 3. Third-Party Websites and Services

### 3.1 External Content

The App provides functionality to fetch data from external websites. When you access these websites through the App:

- **We are not responsible** for how those websites collect, use, or share your data
- **Third-party websites have their own privacy policies** that govern how they handle your information
- You are directly interacting with those third-party services, not with us

### 3.2 Your Responsibility

We strongly encourage you to:

- Review the privacy policies of any websites you access through the App
- Understand the data practices of those third-party services
- Adjust your privacy settings on those websites as needed
- Be cautious about the information you provide to external websites

**Sak96 assumes no liability** for the privacy practices of third-party websites, applications, or services.

## 4. Voluntary Information Sharing

### 4.1 Bug Reports and Feature Requests

When you voluntarily choose to report bugs or request features, you may provide us with information such as:

- Description of the bug or feature request
- Device model and operating system version
- Screenshot or reproduction steps
- Any other information you choose to include

### 4.2 Your Control

- **Participation is entirely voluntary** – you choose whether to report issues
- **No data is required** – you decide what information to share based on your comfort level
- **How we use this information:**
  - To understand and fix technical issues
  - To evaluate feature requests and improve the App
  - To contact you regarding your report if you provide contact information
- **GitHub hosting and public access:** bug reports, feature requests, and related information you submit are stored on GitHub, may be publicly accessible, and are additionally subject to GitHub’s applicable terms and privacy policy.

### 4.3 Communication

If you provide contact information (email or other) with your bug report or feature request, we may use it only to:

- Follow up on your report
- Request clarification
- Notify you of resolutions

We will not use this information for marketing, advertising, or any other purpose without your explicit consent.

## 5. Security and Data Protection

Given that we collect minimal data directly, our security practices focus on:

- **Local data protection:** We recommend that your Android device is protected with a strong lock screen password or biometric authentication
- **Transmission security:** Any data you voluntarily share with us (bug reports, feature requests) is handled with appropriate care
- **No data breaches from us:** Since we don't store user data on our servers, there is no centralized database to compromise

## 6. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
If we become aware that we have received personal information from a child under 13, we will delete such information promptly.
Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided information to us should contact us immediately.

## 7. Your Privacy Rights
